I am Bhavya Kumari, a B.Tech Bioengineering student at VIT Bhopal with a strong interest in molecular docking, computational biology, and bioinformatics. My academic journey has given me hands-on experience with tools like PyRx, AutoDock, and Python for research and data analysis.

I have worked on projects such as:

* **Breast Cancer Phytochemical Study** – Conducted molecular docking to analyze the effects of compounds like quercetin and kaempferol on overexpressed cancer receptors.
* **Aerogriff** – Designed a drone system integrating IoT and machine learning for plant disease detection, hydration monitoring, and fire detection.

Alongside technical skills, I have experience in content writing, scientific communication, and social media marketing through internships and leadership roles in student clubs. I am eager to apply my interdisciplinary skills in research, biotechnology, or science communication roles.
